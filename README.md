## üß¨Project structureüß¨
### N-tier architecture with Spring
Project built by using N-tier architecture divides application
into logical layers:
* **Frontend Framework**: Frontend framework sends a request to the server it reaches our controller.
* **@RestController**: Separates the UI from the backend logic. The controller has a service component autowired which can help him return the request.
* **@Service**: Interacts with data through an autowired repository and contains the business logic.
* **@Repository**: Interacts with the chosen way to persist data. Another name for this layer is the data access layer.
* **Data tier**: data store/retrieve layer.
